Coding challenges, for funsies

# Your challenge
## Should you choose to accept it ...
Complete the coding challenge [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/). Upload your solution in this **repository**. Look up words you don't understand in these directions. *Note: The **bold** words are ones I assumed you would have to look up. If there are other words here that you do not know, I highly suggest looking them up as well.*

# Steps to completion
### Come up with a solution **(~1.5 hours)**
The first step is to come up with any solution that solves the problem. It doesn't have to be pretty, and it doesn't have to be fast. It just has to work. This will be your **MVP**, or Minimum Viable Product.
1. Sign up for a [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) account.
1. Solve the [two-sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) problem. You can use any language you want, but I suggest Python. *At this point, do not look at the solution or other people's answers.*

### Get me your answer **(1.5 hours)**
You'll want to submit this MVP, because sometimes deadlines are more important than perfect code.

1. Sign up for Github
1. **Clone** this repo.
1. **Checkout** a new **branch**
1. Create a new file called `solution.<whatever extention you decided to code in>`
1. Add your solution to this file.
1. **Commit** your changes.
1. **Push** your change to the remote repo.
1. **Make a pull request** to the master branch. *Note: Do not **merge** the branches*

### Refactor your original solution **(30 minutes)**
Likely, your MVP isn't the best you can do. You'll want to submit the cleanest code you can come up with. *Note: don't worry about changing the logic of your function just yet.*

1. **Refactor** your code. Think about things like:
    1. Code **readability**: do your variable names make sense?
    1. **Space Optimization**: did you really need all the data structures you used, or were there better options? 
    1. **Time Optimization**: What is the **O(n)** of the functions you decided to use? Can you pick a better function that serves the same purpose?
1. Get the refactored code to me by making a pull request.

### Come up with a better solution **(2 hours)**
Here, you'll want to actually change the logic behind your solution. There are a few reasons for this.

* You will always have to do this in industry. Your first solution is likely not your best.
* Coding is about being creative. There is always another way to solve the problem. Usually the best team members are the ones who can brainstorm many solutions, and are skilled enough to implement them.
* Learn other styles of coding. When you're researching possible solutions, make note of what makes something readable vs what is confusing. Ask yourself if you're easily able to follow someone elses logic, or if you're stuck guessing what they're trying to accomplish.
1. Come up with a new solution. *Now is the time to look at the solution tab and other answers.*
1. Get this code to me by making a pull request.

## A Note On Budgeting Time
These tasks might take much more time than I estimated above. That's completely ok. Check in with me if your MVP is taking longer than 3 hours, and maybe we can **pair**.
